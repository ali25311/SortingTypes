Sort three arrays (list1, list 2, and list3) five times. 
 
list1 = {1, 2, 3, … ,98, 99, 100}   list2 = {100, 99, 98,…, 3, 2, 1}   list3 = {100, 5, 92,…, 98, 2, 88}   
 
Sort ascending (bubble, insertion, selection, quick (use a random number between 1 and 100 as the pivot), merge)
the arrays where  1. list1 is initially in ascending order 2. list2 is initially in descending order 3. 
list3 is initially in random order .
 
a. Print out the first and last 10 array entries of list1, list2, and list3 before sorting.  
Also print out the first and last 10 array entries after each sort (bubble, insertion, selection, quick, merge). 
 
b. Output the number of comparisons and item assignments made during each sort.  There should be 15 entries. 
 
c. Output the execution time in nanoseconds for each sort. There should be 15 entries.
